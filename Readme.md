# Covid-19 & Pneumonia X-Ray Detector
This project aims to detect COVID-19 from X-ray and also to differentiate COVID-19 from viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia. The dataset contains COVID-19 X-ray images, viral pneumonia X-ray images, bacterial pneumonia X-ray images, and normal person X-ray images. Each class contains 133 images.
