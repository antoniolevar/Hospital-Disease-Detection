# Covid-19 & Pneumonia X-Ray Detector
Aim of this project is to detect Covid-19 from X-ray and also able to differentiate Covid-19 from viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia. I have created a custom dataset that contains covid-19 x-ray images, viral pneumonia x-ray images, bacterial pneumonia x-ray images and normal person x-ray images.Each class contains 133 images.

## Dataset

I have used data from https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset and https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. 

0 - Covid-19

1 - Normal X-ray

2 - Viral Pneumonia X-ray
